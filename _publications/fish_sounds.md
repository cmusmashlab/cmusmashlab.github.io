abstract: 'Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) is emerging as a valuable tool for assessing fish pop-
ulations in natural habitats. This study compares two deep learning-based frameworks:
(1) a multi-label classification system (SegClas) combining Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks and, (2) an object detection ap-
proach (ObjDet) using a YOLO-based model to detect, classify, and count sounds produced
by soniferous fish in the Tagus estuary, Portugal. The target species-Lusitanian toadfish
(Halobatrachus didactylus), meagre (Argyrosomus regius), and weakfish (Cynoscion regalis)-
exhibit overlapping vocalization patterns, posing classification challenges. Results show both
methods achieve high accuracy (over 96%) and F1 scores above 87% for species-level sound
identification, demonstrating their effectiveness under varied noise conditions. ObjDet gen-
erally offers slightly higher classification performance (F1 up to 92%) and can annotate each
vocalization for more precise counting. However, it requires bounding-box annotations and
higher computational costs (inference time of ca. 1.95 seconds per hour of recording). In
contrast, SegClas relies on segment-level labels and provides faster inference (ca. 1.46 sec-
onds per hour). This study also compares both counting strategies, each offering distinct
advantages for different ecological and operational needs. Our results highlight the potential
of deep learning-based PAM for fish population assessment.'
