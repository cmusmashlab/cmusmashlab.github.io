abstract: "The use of audio and video modalities for Human Activity Recognition (HAR)\
  \ is common, given the richness of the data and the availability of pre-trained\
  \ ML models using a large corpus of labeled training data. However, audio and video\
  \ sensors also lead to significant consumer privacy concerns. A key limitation of\
  \ prior approaches is that most of them do not readily generalize across environments\
  \ and require significant in-situ training data. In this paper, we generalize this\
  \ concept to create a novel system called VAX (Video/Audio to \u2018X\u2019), where\
  \ training labels acquired from existing Video/Audio ML models are used to train\
  \ ML models for a wide range of \u2018X\u2019 privacy-sensitive sensors. Once the\
  \ ML models for the privacy-sensitive sensors are trained, with little to no user\
  \ involvement, the Audio/Video sensors can be removed altogether to protect the\
  \ user\u2019s privacy better. We built and deployed VAX in ten participants\u2019\
  \ homes while they performed 17 common activities of daily living. "
