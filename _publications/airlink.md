  We introduce AirLink, a novel technique for sharing files between multiple devices. By waving a hand from one device towards another, users can directly transfer files between them. The system utilizes the devices' built-in speakers and microphones to enable easy file sharing between phones, tablets and laptops. We evaluate our system in an 11-participant study with 96.8% accuracy, showing the feasibility of using AirLink in a multiple-device environment. We also implemented a real-time system and demonstrate the capability of AirLink in various applications.
