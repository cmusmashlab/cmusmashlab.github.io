abstract: "A scarf is inherently reconfigurable: wearers often use it as a neck wrap,\
  \ a shawl, a headband, a wristband, and more. We developed uKnit, a scarf-like soft\
  \ sensor with scarf-like reconfigurability, built with machine knitting and electrical\
  \ impedance tomography sens- ing. Soft wearable devices are comfortable and thus\
  \ attractive for many human-computer interaction scenarios. While prior work has\
  \ demonstrated various soft wearable capabilities, each capability is device- and\
  \ location-specific, being incapable of meeting users\u2019 various needs with a\
  \ single device. In contrast, uKnit explores the possibility of one-soft-wearable-for-all.\
  \ We describe the fabrication and sensing principles behind uKnit, demonstrate several\
  \ exam- ple applications, and evaluate it with 10-participant user studies and a\
  \ washability test."
