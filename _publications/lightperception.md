abstract: 'People spend more than 90% of their time indoors, and, as such, improving
  indoor lighting quality can enhance their quality of life by positively influencing
  both physiological and psychological aspects. Numerous studies suggest that perceptions
  of a space vary depending on a number of lighting attributes present. Significant
  effort has been made across various fields to identify the spatial lighting conditions
  and attributes that impact human perception, although we lack studies that explore
  the impact of these conditions in tandem. This paper investigates how interior lighting
  conditions influence human impressions of room ambiance. The study examines 16 different
  interior scenes, considering factors such as sky condition (sunny vs. overcast),
  shading blinds position (open vs. closed), presence or absence of electric light
  (on vs. off), and Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) (2700 K, 4000 K, and 6500 K). '
