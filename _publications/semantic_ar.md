abstract: This paper presents a semantic-based interactive system that enables virtual
  content placement using natural language. We propose a novel computational framework
  composed of three components including 3D reconstruction, 3D segmentation, and 3D
  annotation. Based on the framework, the system can automatically construct a semantic
  representation of the environment from raw point cloud data. Users can then assign
  virtual content to a specific physical location by referring to its semantic label.
  Compared with traditional projection mapping which may involve tedious manual adjustments,
  the proposed system can facilitate intuitive and efficient manipulation of virtual
  content in immersive environments through speech inputs. The technical evaluation
  and user study results show that the system can provide users with accurate semantic
  information for effective virtual content placement at room scale.
