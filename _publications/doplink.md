  Mobile and embedded electronics are pervasive in today's environment. As such, it is necessary to have a natural and intuitive way for users to indicate the intent to connect to these devices from a distance. We present DopLink, an ultrasonic-based device selection approach. It utilizes the already embedded audio hardware in smart devices to determine if a particular device is being pointed at by another device (i.e., the user waves their mobile phone at a target in a pointing motion). We evaluate the accuracy of DopLink in a controlled user study, showing that, within 3 meters, it has an average accuracy of 95% for device selection and 97% for finding relative device position. Finally, we show three applications of DopLink: rapid device pairing, home automation, and multi-display synchronization.
