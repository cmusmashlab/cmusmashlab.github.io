abstract: "Sound presents an invaluable signal source that enables computing systems\
  \ to perform daily activity recognition. However, microphones are optimized for\
  \ human speech and hearing ranges: capturing private content, such as speech, while\
  \ omitting useful, inaudible information that can aid in acoustic recognition tasks.\
  \ We simulated acoustic recognition tasks using sounds from 127 everyday household/workplace\
  \ objects, finding that inaudible frequencies can act as a substitute for privacy-sensitive\
  \ frequencies. To take advantage of these inaudible frequencies, we designed a Raspberry\
  \ Pi-based device that captures inaudible acoustic frequencies with settings that\
  \ can remove speech or all audible frequencies entirely. We conducted a perception\
  \ study, where participants \u201Ceavesdropped\u201D on PrivacyMic\u2019s filtered\
  \ audio and found that none of our participants could transcribe speech. "
