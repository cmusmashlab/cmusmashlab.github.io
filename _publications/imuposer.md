abstract: "Tracking body pose on-the-go could have powerful uses in fitness, mobile\
  \ gaming, context-aware virtual assistants, and rehabilitation. However, users are\
  \ unlikely to buy and wear special suits or sensor arrays to achieve this end. Instead,\
  \ in this work, we explore the feasibility of estimating body pose using IMUs already\
  \ in devices that many users own \u2014 namely smartphones, smartwatches, and earbuds.\
  \ This approach has several challenges, including noisy data from low-cost commodity\
  \ IMUs, and the fact that the number of instrumentation points on a user\u2019s\
  \ body is both sparse and in flux. Our pipeline receives whatever subset of IMU\
  \ data is available, potentially from just a single device, and produces a best-guess\
  \ pose. To evaluate our model, we created the IMUPoser Dataset, collected from 10\
  \ participants wearing or holding off-the-shelf consumer devices and across a variety\
  \ of activity contexts. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of our system, benchmarking\
  \ it on both our own and existing IMU datasets."
