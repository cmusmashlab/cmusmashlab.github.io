abstract: "A user often needs training and guidance while performing several daily\
  \ life procedures, e.g., cooking, setting up a new appliance, or doing a COVID test.\
  \ Watch-based human activity recognition (HAR) can track users\u2019 actions during\
  \ these procedures. However, out of the box, state-of-the-art HAR struggles from\
  \ noisy data and less-expressive actions that are often part of daily life tasks.\
  \ This paper proposes PrISM-Tracker, a procedure-tracking framework that augments\
  \ existing HAR models with (1) graph-based procedure representation and (2) a user-interaction\
  \ module to handle model uncertainty. Specifically, PrISM-Tracker extends a Viterbi\
  \ algorithm to update state probabilities based on time-series HAR outputs by leveraging\
  \ the graph representation that embeds time information as prior. Moreover, the\
  \ model identifies moments or classes of uncertainty and asks the user for guidance\
  \ to improve tracking accuracy. We tested PrISM-Tracker in two procedures: latte-making\
  \ in an engineering lab study and wound care"
