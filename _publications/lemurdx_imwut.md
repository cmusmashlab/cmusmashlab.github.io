abstract: "Hyperactivity is the most dominant presentation of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity\
  \ Disorder in young children. Currently, measuring hyperactivity involves parents\u2019\
  \ or teachers\u2019 reports. These reports are vulnerable to subjectivity and can\
  \ lead to misdiagnosis. LemurDx provides an objective measure of hyperactivity using\
  \ passive mobile sensing. We collected data from 61 children (25 with hyperactivity)\
  \ who wore a smartwatch for up to 7 days without changing their daily routine. The\
  \ participants\u2019 parents maintained a log of the child\u2019s activities at\
  \ a half-hour granularity (e.g., sitting, exercising) as contextual information.\
  \ Our ML models achieved 85.2% accuracy in detecting hyperactivity in children (using\
  \ parent-provided activity labels). We also built models that estimated children\u2019\
  s context from the sensor data and did not rely on activity labels to reduce parent\
  \ burden."
