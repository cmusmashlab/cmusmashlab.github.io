abstract: 'Inside-out tracking of human body poses using wearable sensors holds significant
  potential for AR/VR applications, such as remote communication through 3D avatars
  with expressive body language. Current inside-out systems often rely on vision-based
  methods utilizing handheld controllers or incorporating densely distributed body-worn
  IMU sensors. The former limits hands-free and occlusion-robust interactions, while
  the latter is plagued by inadequate accuracy and jittering. We introduce a novel
  body tracking system, MI-Poser, which employs AR glasses and two wrist-worn electromagnetic
  field (EMF) sensors to achieve high-fidelity upper-body pose estimation while mitigating
  metal interference. Our lightweight system demonstrates a minimal error (6.6 cm
  mean joint position error) with real-world data collected from 10 participants.
  It remains robust against various upper-body movements and operates efficiently
  at 60 Hz. '
